## **AdventureWorks Sales Performance Dashboard | Power BI Project**

Welcome to the **AdventureWorks Sales Performance Dashboard**! This interactive Power BI dashboard analyzes a rich dataset from Microsoft's AdventureWorks, a fictional bicycle manufacturing company. The goal is to uncover sales insights, evaluate performance across categories, regions, and resellers, and demonstrate business intelligence capabilities using Power BI.

## **Project Objective**

The primary aim of this project is to provide data-driven insights into sales performance across product categories, customer types, and geographic regions over multiple fiscal years. Key questions addressed include:

* How do sales trends evolve over time?
* Which reseller or channel drives the highest revenue?
* What is the sales distribution by region?
* How do different product categories perform?
* Where are the business opportunities geographically?
